****Ending Script draft****

Nai Nai only lived with us maybe 2 or 3 years before she left for China. (note: how to mention her passing here? as the source of a lot of my unprocessed grief)

when I was a kid Nai Nai would used to make chao bing with leftover scallion pancakes from earlier in the week.
It was a special treat that only happened under certain conditions of having leftover cong you bing from the day earlier.

If her cong you bing was good, the chao bing was so much better. stir frying made the dough all the extra glutinous and absorb the umami ofâ€“i forget what exactly, sliced onions? soy sauce? some type of meat?

i barely can find recipes online, they all look not quite correct.

I just need to learn how to make it my own way.

(Cue chao bing cooking game~~)

FIN.
