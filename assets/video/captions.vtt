00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:10.100
Somewhere along the way,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.001
before I can even remember,

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.167
I got the memo something is wrong with me.

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:16.701
I'm not good enough.

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.701
If something bad happens, it's my fault.

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:22.568
I have to always fix something about myself.

00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:24.335
I have to work harder.

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:26.202
I can't make mistakes.

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:28.835
I must anticipate every scenario,

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:31.669
risk, reaction.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.836
Don't be too needy.

00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:35.736
I hate myself.

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:37.536
I'm too sensitive.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:38.936
I'm sorry.

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:40.603
Stop crying.

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:41.836
I'm sorry.

00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:43.037
It's my fault.

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:44.737
Something's wrong with me.

00:00:44.737 --> 00:00:47.570
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:51.404
But I've been trying to understand that

00:00:51.404 --> 00:00:52.337
just because it all

00:00:52.337 --> 00:00:55.338
feels like my fault doesn't mean it is.

00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:56.538
I learned that the people

00:00:56.538 --> 00:00:58.405
who have caused me the most pain

00:00:58.405 --> 00:01:01.205
do so because of their own pain, too.

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:05.838
That the ways I felt not good enough were reinforced

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:08.172
by the way they might struggle with that too.

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.939
The ways my sadness couldn’t be held

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.739
mirrored by the challenge of holding their own.

00:01:14.973 --> 00:01:17.239
Sometimes I'm sad about what could have been.

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:19.106
The pasts I never had.

00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:21.173
The years I could have gotten back.

00:01:21.173 --> 00:01:22.640
The person I could have been.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.573
The people we might all have been

00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:27.707
if things didn't have to play out the way they did.

00:01:27.707 --> 00:01:29.707
But I can't change the past.

00:01:29.707 --> 00:01:32.707
I can't rewrite what can't be rewritten.

00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:36.541
But what I need to do

00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:39.541
is build the world I need for myself.

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:42.708
If what hurt me is avoidance, neglect,

00:01:42.842 --> 00:01:44.975
brushing things under the rug,

00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:47.775
I'll go directly to the site where it all happened.

00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:49.642
I'll stare in the face.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:50.809
I'll go back to the things

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.376
that everyone else long forgot about.

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:56.376
If what hurt me is the pressure to just move on.

00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:58.076
I'll let myself dwell.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:02.510
I’ll play things over and over as much as I need.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.977
Write and rewrite, over and over,

00:02:04.977 --> 00:02:06.744
about the things that no one else

00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:08.177
wants to hear about anymore.

00:02:09.344 --> 00:02:11.344
If what hurt me is not being heard

00:02:11.344 --> 00:02:14.278
in my sadness, and in my desires,

00:02:14.278 --> 00:02:17.311
I'll show up over and over to hear myself.

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:20.178
I'll be the person I didn't have but needed.

00:02:20.178 --> 00:02:22.312
I'll practice over and over again,

00:02:22.312 --> 00:02:25.312
seeing myself and letting myself be seen.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:28.712
I'll practice over and over again.

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.779
I'll practice over and over again.

00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:34.879
I'll practice over and over again.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.880
Seeing myself and letting myself be seen

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.680
by the people who can care for me

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.613
in the ways I need.

00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:44.447
I'll reprogram it all line by line,

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:46.947
even if it's slow and redundant,

00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:49.947
even if it's a lot of fucking work.

00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:54.081
I'll take every flaky, doughy layer of who I am,

00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:57.081
and chop, and combine, and integrate,

00:02:57.448 --> 00:03:01.215
and mix, and remix, and season, and transmute.

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:03.682
Over and over and over.

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:05.782
Until I transform into something new.

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.016
Until the day I won't be so afraid anymore.

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:12.816
Until the day that I can really believe

00:03:12.816 --> 00:03:14.116
in every slice of me,

00:03:14.116 --> 00:03:16.283
and every slice that comes,

00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:18.783
that there was nothing wrong with me then.

00:03:18.783 --> 00:03:21.117
There's nothing wrong with me now.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:23.217
There was nothing wrong with me this whole time.
