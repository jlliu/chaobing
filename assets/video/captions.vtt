00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:12.767
Somewhere along the way,

2
00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:14.667
before I can even remember,

3
00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.834
I got the memo something is wrong with me.

4
00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:19.368
I'm not good enough.

5
00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:22.368
If something bad happens, it's my fault.

6
00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:25.235
I have to always fix something about myself.

7
00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:27.002
I have to work harder.

8
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.869
I can't make mistakes.

9
00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.502
I must anticipate every scenario,

10
00:00:31.502 --> 00:00:34.336
risk, reaction.

11
00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:36.503
Don't be too needy.

12
00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.403
I hate myself.

13
00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:40.203
I'm too sensitive.

14
00:00:40.203 --> 00:00:41.603
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:41.603 --> 00:00:43.270
Stop crying.

16
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.503
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:45.703
It's my fault.

18
00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:47.404
Something's wrong with me.

19
00:00:47.404 --> 00:00:50.237
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20
00:00:52.404 --> 00:00:54.071
But I've been trying to understand that

21
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:55.004
just because it all

22
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:58.004
feels like my fault doesn't mean it is.

23
00:00:58.004 --> 00:00:59.205
I learned that the people

24
00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:01.071
who have caused me the most pain

25
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:03.872
do so because of their own pain, too.

26
00:01:05.572 --> 00:01:08.505
That the ways I felt not good enough were reinforced

27
00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:10.839
by the way they might struggle with that too.

28
00:01:11.206 --> 00:01:13.606
The ways my sadness couldn’t be held

29
00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.406
mirrored by the challenge of holding their own.

30
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.906
Sometimes I'm sad about what could have been.

31
00:01:19.906 --> 00:01:21.773
The pasts I never had.

32
00:01:21.773 --> 00:01:23.840
The years I could have gotten back.

33
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.307
The person I could have been.

34
00:01:25.307 --> 00:01:27.240
The people we might all have been

35
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.374
if things didn't have to play out the way they did.

36
00:01:30.374 --> 00:01:32.374
But I can't change the past.

37
00:01:32.374 --> 00:01:35.374
I can't rewrite what can't be rewritten.

38
00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:39.208
But what I need to do

39
00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:42.208
is build the world I need for myself.

40
00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:45.375
If what hurt me is avoidance, neglect,

41
00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.642
brushing things under the rug,

42
00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:50.442
I'll go directly to the site where it all happened.

43
00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:52.309
I'll stare in the face.

44
00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:53.476
I'll go back to the things

45
00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:56.043
that everyone else long forgot about.

46
00:01:56.043 --> 00:01:59.043
If what hurt me is the pressure to just move on.

47
00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:00.743
I'll let myself dwell.

48
00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:05.177
I’ll play things over and over as much as I need.

49
00:02:05.177 --> 00:02:07.644
Write and rewrite, over and over,

50
00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:09.411
about the things that no one else

51
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:10.844
wants to hear about anymore.

52
00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:14.011
If what hurt me is not being heard

53
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:16.945
in my sadness, and in my desires,

54
00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:19.978
I'll show up over and over to hear myself.

55
00:02:19.978 --> 00:02:22.845
I'll be the person I didn't have but needed.

56
00:02:22.845 --> 00:02:24.979
I'll practice over and over again,

57
00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.979
seeing myself and letting myself be seen.

58
00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.379
I'll practice over and over again.

59
00:02:32.446 --> 00:02:35.446
I'll practice over and over again.

60
00:02:35.513 --> 00:02:37.546
I'll practice over and over again.

61
00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:40.547
Seeing myself and letting myself be seen

62
00:02:40.547 --> 00:02:42.347
by the people who can care for me

63
00:02:42.347 --> 00:02:44.280
in the ways I need.

64
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.114
I'll reprogram it all line by line,

65
00:02:47.114 --> 00:02:49.614
even if it's slow and redundant,

66
00:02:49.614 --> 00:02:52.614
even if it's a lot of fucking work.

67
00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:56.748
I'll take every flaky, doughy layer of who I am,

68
00:02:56.748 --> 00:02:59.748
and chop, and combine, and integrate,

69
00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:03.882
and mix, and remix, and season, and transmute.

70
00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:06.349
Over and over and over.

71
00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.449
Until I transform into something new.

72
00:03:09.716 --> 00:03:12.683
Until the day I won't be so afraid anymore.

73
00:03:12.683 --> 00:03:15.483
Until the day that I can really believe

74
00:03:15.483 --> 00:03:16.783
in every slice of me,

75
00:03:16.783 --> 00:03:18.950
and every slice that comes,

76
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.450
that there was nothing wrong with me then.

77
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.784
There's nothing wrong with me now.

78
00:03:23.784 --> 00:03:25.884
There was nothing wrong with me this whole time.
